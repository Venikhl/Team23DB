# Notebooks

## Overview

This directory contains a single Jupyter Notebook (ml.ipynb) that is a learning and uderstanding part of the project. This notebook is used for interactive data analysis, machine learning model development, and result visualization using PySpark and Spark MLlib.

## File Details

* ml.ipynb: A notebook containing the following sections:

  * Data Loading & Preparation: Reads data from Hive tables (trip data) and performs initial cleaning and exploration.
  * Feature Engineering: Creates features for machine learning models, including numerical and categorical encoding.
  * Machine Learning Modeling:
    * Builds multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees).
    * Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch and CrossValidation.
    * Evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
  * Results and Analysis: Displays model performance and key insights using plots and tables.
